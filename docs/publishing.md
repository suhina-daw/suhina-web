# Publishing to suhina.org

The GitHub repository is public. GitHub Pages can host the static Vite build; no server or Worker is required. Domain registration and DNS can stay at Namecheap.

## Verification and approval

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` runs technical checks on pushes and pull requests: Node data-validation/search tests, Python exporter tests and the production build. It uploads only `dist` as a Pages artifact. It does not check out the DAW source or repeat a settings-content review. The native repository owns that review and the settings-coverage gate.

Initial website publication is manual: run **Verify and publish website** from `main` and explicitly select **publish_reviewed_site** after release authorization. Ordinary code pushes and pull requests do not deploy in this initial setup.

**Follow DAW main settings** runs about every 30 minutes and can be dispatched manually on web `main`. Its source repository and `main` ref are fixed in the workflow; there is no branch input. The importer additionally verifies official origin and the fetched `origin/main` commit and reads the committed `docs/guide-data/settings.json` blob. It accepts schemaVersion 1, requires source-reviewed complete help and records provenance in `public/settings-source.json`. Missing, stale or invalid source data fails the run before any update is committed or published. No local checkout or unmerged UI setting is a fallback.

Changed data is tested and built before an automated commit updates only the two generated public JSON files. This uses the website's own workflow token, not a cross-repository secret. After the first approved Pages/domain setup, set the repository Actions variable `PAGES_SYNC_PUBLISH` to `true` to let these source-approved data changes deploy automatically. This is a one-time publication setting, not another content approval. Pushes made with the workflow token do not trigger the ordinary push workflow, so the synchronization workflow itself builds and uploads the deployment artifact. Invalid data leaves the last site intact. A native change with identical exported data creates no new web commit.

Settings prose must be approved in the native repository, alongside its implementation. Local `helpStatus: reviewed` means the author checked implementation evidence; it is not proof of source-repository approval. The companion native export PR migrates the current main subset into that repository. Merge that source PR before running synchronization. This does not introduce a second review gate in the web repository. The older web `settings-help.json` and Python exporter remain as historical migration inputs; the automated importer never uses them.

## GitHub setup

1. In repository Settings → Pages, select GitHub Actions as the build source.
2. Verify ownership of `suhina.org` in the organization's Pages settings using the TXT record GitHub supplies. Its exact verification name and value come from GitHub and must not be guessed.
3. Set the repository's custom domain to `suhina.org` before pointing its DNS to GitHub. A custom Actions deployment does not require a `CNAME` file in the repository.
4. After content approval, manually dispatch the publishing workflow on `main`.
5. Once DNS validation and certificate issuance succeed, enable Enforce HTTPS.

## Namecheap DNS

In Domain List → suhina.org → Manage → Advanced DNS, replace only the conflicting parking or URL Redirect host records for `@` and `www` with:

| Type | Host | Value | TTL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | @ | 185.199.108.153 | Automatic |
| A | @ | 185.199.109.153 | Automatic |
| A | @ | 185.199.110.153 | Automatic |
| A | @ | 185.199.111.153 | Automatic |
| CNAME | www | suhina-daw.github.io | Automatic |

Keep unrelated records, particularly mail and domain-verification records. Do not change nameservers for this GitHub Pages setup. If an existing AAAA record points at another host, reconcile it before enabling the domain; optional GitHub IPv6 addresses are listed in the official instructions. The organization verification TXT record is additional to the host records above.

The custom domain serves the app at `/`, matching Vite's current base. Without a custom domain, this repository's default project URL is under `/suhina-web/` and requires a corresponding Vite base; do not use that URL as the final deployment test with the root-domain build.

## Finish checks

Check `https://suhina.org`, the `www` redirect, HTTPS, the brand assets and `settings.json`. Test search, categories, expanded explanations, keyboard controls and a mobile viewport. Record any outstanding content or layout review before approving the first public release.
